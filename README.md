# KYC Transparency and Security for Banking using Blockchain and IPFS

## ABSTRACT

The know your customer or know your client (KYC) is a guideline for the banking 
system to validate a customer using identity, appropriateness, risk assessment in establishing 
a banking relationship. With the growing concern of security, the KYC process is complex and 
involves a high cost for completing for a single customer. In this work, we propose an 
economical, swift, secure, and transparent platform for KYC document verification for the 
Banking system through Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain technology. The 
proposed system allows a customer to open an account at one Bank, complete the KYC process 
there, and generate a hash value using the IPFS network and share it using the blockchain 
technique. Upon receiving the private key, any Bank/financial organization can retrieve, store 
customer data (i.e., KYC) securely using IPFS network if the customer wishes to open another 
account in that Bank/financial organization. The proposed system can save time, money, and 
repetitive work during the KYC process when someone tries to open an account at multiple 
Banks
